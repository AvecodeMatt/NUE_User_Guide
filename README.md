# NUE User Manual

Thank you for choosing Aveco. This guide is meant to show you standard applications in NUE as well as typical user tasks and operations utilized in everyday use of our product. Keep in mind that this guide does not introduce or describe the installation of NUE or configuration procedures. You may notice that the material in this user guide can differ from your actual experience. That’s ok! This document describes standard NUE features which, depending on your specific project and/or user rights, can differ substantially. You can find more detailed information related to your configuration and user rights in your project’s specification document.

Keep in mind that, since all NUE operations and procedures are presented during user training provided by Aveco, this document contains only a brief overview and general information of NUE and does not, in any way, fully replace the training provided.

NUE, or “New User Experience,” is a direct reference to our new user interface. NUE is meant to run and feel like a stand-alone operating system, and for this reason, we recommend that NUE be run in full-screen mode. 

If we compare NUE to the previous QNX Photon environment, NUE adds multi-platform support, an all new graphics design, and brand new applications tailored to fit your needs, giving you the opportunity to customize not only the look and feel of the application, but also the functionality. 

While NUE is a light-weight, platform-independent client, its operations are still processed by automation servers running on the real-time OS QNX to ensure optimal precision and stability of the system.
