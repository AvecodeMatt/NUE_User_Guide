# Utilizing the Applications Sections

## Layout

The [Main Applications](./), [MCR Applications](../mcr-master-control-room-applications/), and  Tools sections have been written in a standard way to make finding the information you need quick and easy. 

### Each application listed in these chapters is subdivided using the following scheme:

* **Application Name**
  * Ribbon
  * Application Area
  * Side Panels
  * Examples \(optionally\)
